Serial console
==============
For debugging the program, one needs  to print some
information such as variable values and error messages. Python has built-in command
`print()` which does that. The output of print command is sent to `serial console` -
which in practice just means that it is sent over USB to the computer.

Thonny editor has built-in serial console (Shell), so you can see these messages.


Among other features it provides is the ability to enter Python commands
interactively in the console, without saving them to a file - this is very
useful for testing various things. This is called REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop);
